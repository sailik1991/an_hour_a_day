Hello, it's me.
       Em         G/D              D                 C          Em  G/D   D    C
I was wondering if after all these years you'd like to meet, to go over everything
               Em             G/D                     D         C
They say that time's supposed to heal you, but I ain't done much healing.
  Em G/D       D    C
Hello, can you hear me?
       Em        G/D             D         C                  Em    G/D  D   C
I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be when we were younger and free.
         Em        G/D                D            C
I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet.
 
 
[Pre-Chorus]
                Em       D   Bm  C
There's such a difference between us
       Em  D  C
and a million miles.
 
 
[Chorus]
Em          C         G/D  D
Hello from the other side,
  Em             C          G/D  D
I must've called a thousand times to tell you
Em   C               G/D            D
I'm sorry, for everything that I've done,
            Em       C    G/D       D
But when I call you never seem to be home.
Em         C      G/D  D
Hello from the outside,
   Em           C             G/D D
At least I can say that I've tried to tell you
Em    C         G/D         D
I'm sorry, for breaking your heart
                 Em       C             G/D      D
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore.

Hello, how are you?
        Em       G/D           D            C
It's so typical of me to talk about myself, I'm sorry
   Em G/D          D     C
I hope that you're well
        Em         G/D                      D       C
Did you ever make it out of that town where nothing ever happened?
 
 
[Pre-Chorus]
         Em D           Bm     C
It's no secret that the both of us
     Em      D      C
are running out of time.
